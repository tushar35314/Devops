Linux Login
--------------

login is used when signing onto a system. 
The user and group ID will be set according to their values in the /etc/passwd file
There is one exception if the user ID is zero: in this case, only the primary group ID of the account is set.
This should allow the system adminitrator to login even in case of network problems

The value for  $HOME, $USER, $SHELL, $PATH, $LOGNAME, and $MAIL are set according to the appropriate fields in the password entry.

$PATH defaults to /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin for normal users, 
and to /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin for root if not other configured.

Then the user's shell is started, /bin/sh is used as default. 
 
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export PATH

export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/dir"
