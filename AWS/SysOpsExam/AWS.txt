Advantages of Cloud Computing
================================
1: IT Assets as Provisioned Resources
2: Global, available and Scalable Capacity
3: High Level Managed Service
4: Build-it Security
5: Architecting for cost

Operating Models for AWS
-------------------------
1: Application that are migrated and maintain existing traditional operating model
2: Solution that are refactored leverage higher level of automation of the operational process
3: Solution that are re-architectured and designed for cloud operations

Design Principles
-------------------
1: Scalability
	There are two ways to scale an IT architecture : vertical and horizontally
	
	- Scaling Vertically
		Scaling vertically takes place through an increase in the specifications of an individual resource, such as upgrading a server with a larger hard drive or a faster CPU.
		With Amazon EC2, you can stop an instance and resize it upgraded instance type that has more CPU, Memory, I/O or Networking Capabilities.
		This type of scaling is not always cost-efficent
		
	- Scaling Horizontally
		Scaling Horizontally takes place through increase in the number of resources such as adding more hard drives to a storage array. 
		Not all architectures are designed to distribute their workload to multiple resources
		
		Stateless Applications
		When user or service interact with an application they will often perform a series of interaction that form a session. 
		A session is unique data for users that persists between requests while they use the application.
		A stateless application is an application that does not need knowledge of previous interactions and does not store session information
		For example, an application that, given the same input, provides the same response to any end user, is a stateless application
		
		Distribute Load to Multiple Nodes
		To distribute the workload to multiple nodes in your environment, you can choose either a push or a pull model.
		
		With push model you can use the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute work load. 
		- ELB routes incoming application requests across multiple EC2 instances. 
		- While routing the traffic, a Network load Balancer operates at layer 4 of Open System Interconnections(OSI) model to handle millions of requests per second
		
		 With the adoption of container-based services, you can also use an Application Load Balancer.
		- An Application Load Balancer provides Layer 7 of the OSI model and supports contentbased routing of requests based on application traffic.
		- Alternatively, you can use Amazon Route 53 to implement a DNS round robin. 
		
		Instead of a load balancing solution, you can implement a pull model for asynchronous, event-driven workloads. 
		- Tasks that need to be performed or data that needs to be processed can be stored as messages in a queue using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) or as a streaming data solution
		-  Multiple compute resources can then pull and consume those messages, processing them in a distributed fashion
