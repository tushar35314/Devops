Proxy servers are software applications that run on your firewall machine in order to provide indirect Internet access to your network.
The firewall can be either a “single-homed” host or a “dual-homed” host. 

Single-homed
---------------
A single-homed host is a machine with one network card. This configuration relies on the Internet router to block all packets to any machine except the firewall. 

Dual-homed
------------
A dual-homed host is a machine with two network cards that has routing capabilities disabled. Computers behind the firewall can talk to the dual-homed host, and computers on the Internet can communicate with the dual-homed host. However, since routing between the network cards is disabled, the computers behind the firewall cannot talk directly to the computers on the Internet.

The proxy server is used to allow Internet access from inside the protected network through either the single or dual-homed host firewall.
The client applications speak directly to the proxy server and the proxy server in turn speaks directly to the Internet hosts on behalf of the client, thus acting as a proxy.

This interaction allows Internet access to all clients on the internal network, but leaves only one machine, the firewall, directly vulnerable to attacks from the Internet.

- The proxy server takes a packet from inside your network that is bound for the Internet and changes the “from” address to its own address.
- It then forwards the packet to the destination host.
- The beauty of the proxy server is that the destination host thinks it is talking only to the firewall
- When the firewall receives the response from the destination host, the proxy server sends the packet back to the original requesting machine.
