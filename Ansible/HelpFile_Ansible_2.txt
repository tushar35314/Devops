Ansible by default manages machines over the SSH protocol

Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running. You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.

Control Machine Requirement
------------------------------
Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed (Windows is not supported)

Managed Node Requirement
------------------------
On the managed nodes, you need a way to communicate, which is normally ssh. 
By default, Ansible uses the python interpreter located at /usr/bin/python to run its modules. 

Installing on the Control Machine
-----------------------------------
Fedora: $ sudo dnf install ansible
RHEL or CentOS: $ sudo yum install ansible
To enable the Ansible Engine repository, run the following command : $ sudo subsription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-ansible-2.5-rpms

Ubuntu: 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ansible

Configuring Ansible
--------------------
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/installation_guide/intro_configuration.html#intro-configuration


Certain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file (ansible.cfg). Path: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


Now that you have installed Ansible, let's get started with some of the basics
The remote system hosts needs to be placed in : /etc/ansible/hosts. Your public SSH Keys should be located in the authorized_keys on those system. 

To ping all the nodes: $ ansible all -m ping
To run a live command on all your node: $ ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"
