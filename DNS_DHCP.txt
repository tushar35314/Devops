Domain Name System (DNS)
=========================

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dns-domain-name-server/

DNS is a host name to IP address translation service. It is an application layer protocol for message exchange between clients and servers.
DNS is used to convert the domain name of the websites to their numerical IP address.

There are various kinds of domains

-  Generic Domain 
	com(commercial) .edu(educational) .mil(military) .org(non profit organization) .net(similar to commercial) all these are generic domain
- Country domain
	.in (india) .us .uk

In IP address comprises of two component: 1: Network Component	2: Host Component. Each of the 4 bytes is represented by a number from 0 to 255, separated with dots

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
-------------------------------
refers to a web address which uniquely identifies a document over the internet. There are two type of URLs 
- Absolute URL
- Relative URL

Absolute URL is a complete address of a resource on the web. For example http:// www.tutorialspoint.com / internet_technology /index.htm
- http is the protocol
- tutorialspoint.com is the server name
- index.htm is the file name.

Relative URL is a partial address of a webpage, the protocol and server part are omitted from relative URL.

DNS Architecture
==================
The Domain name system comprises of Domain Names, Domain Name Space, Name Server 

Domain Name
	Domain Name is a symbolic string associated with an IP address. There are several Domain name such as com, edu, gov, net 
	
Domain Name Space
	The domain name space refers a hierarchy in the internet naming structure. This hierarchy has multiple levels (from 0 to 127), with a root at the top

Name Server
	Name server contains the DNS database. This database comprises of various names and their corresponding IP addresses.Since it is not possible for a single server to maintain entire DNS database, therefore, the information is distributed among many DNS servers.
	
Zones
	Zone is collection of nodes (sub domains) under the main domain. The server maintains a database called zone file for every zone.
	
Types of Name Server
====================
- Root
- Primary
- Secondary

Root Server
	Root Server is the top level server which consists of the entire DNS tree
	
Primary Server
	Primary Server stores a file about its zone.It has authority to create, maintain, and update the zone file.
	
Secondary 
	Secondary Server transfers complete information about a zone from another server which may be primary or secondary server. 
	
DNS Working
===========
DNS translates the domain name into IP address automatically. Following are the steps taken to do so

- When we type www.tutorialspoint.com into the browser, it asks the local DNS Server for its IP address. (local DNS is at ISP end)
- When the local DNS does not find the IP address of requested domain name, if forwards he request to the root DNS server. 
- The root DNS server replies with delegation that I do not know the IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com but know the IP address of DNS Server.
- The local DNS server then asks the com DNS Server the same question.
- The com DNS Server replies the same that it does not know the IP address of www.tutorialspont.com but knows the address of tutorialspoint.com.
- Then the local DNS asks the tutorialspoint.com DNS server the same question.
- Then tutorialspoint.com DNS server replies with IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com.
- Now, the local DNS sends the IP address of www.tutorialspoint.com to the computer that sends the request.


Summary
--------
- The client machine sends a request to the local name server
- Which, if root does not find the address in its database, sends a request to the root name server
- Which in turn, will route the query to an intermediate or authoritative name server. 


DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
==========================================
https://www.9tut.com/dhcp-tutorial

In IP environment, before a computer can communicate to another one, they need to have their own IP addresses. There are two ways of configuring the IP address on device. 

- Statically assign an IP address. This means we manually type an IP address for this computer
- Use a protocol so that the computer can obtain its IP address automatically (dynamically). DHCP

A big advantage of using DHCP is the ability to join a network without knowing detail about it.

How does DHCP works
---------------------
- When a client boots up for the first time (or try to join a new network), it needs to obtain an IP address to communicate
- So it first transmits a DHCPDISCOVER message on its local subnet
- The client does not have a configured IP address, so the source IP address of 0.0.0.0 is used.
- The purpose of DHCPDISCOVER message is to try to find out a DHCP Server (a server that can assign IP addresses).

- After receiving the discover message, the DHCP Server will dynamically pick up an unassigned IP address from its IP pool and broadcast a DHCPOFFER message to the client(*).
- DHCPOFFER message could contain other information such as subnet mask, default gateway, IP address lease time, and domain name server (DNS).

- If the client accepts the offer, it then broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message saying it will take this IP address. 
- It is called request message because the client might deny the offer by requesting another IP address. 
- Notice that DHCPREQUEST message is still a broadcast message because the DHCP client has still not received an acknowledged IP. 
- DHCP Client can receive DHCPOFFER messages from other DHCP Servers so sending broadcast DHCPREQUEST message is also a way to inform other offers have been rejected. 

- When the DHCP Server receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the client, the DHCP Server accepts the request by sending the client a unicast DHCPACKNOWLEDGEMENT message (DHCPACK).

******************************************************************************************************************************
In conclusion there are four messages sent between the DHCP Client and DHCP Server: DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACKNOWLEDGEMENT. This process are often abbreviated as DORA (for Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledgment).
******************************************************************************************************************************

After receiving DHCPACKNOWLEDGEMENT, the IP address is leased to the DHCP Client. A client will usually keep the same address by periodically contacting the DHCP server to renew the lease before the lease expires.

If the DHCP Server is not on the same subnet with the DHCP Client, we need to configure the router on the DHCP client side to act as a DHCP Relay Agent so that it can forward DHCP messages between the DHCP Client & DHCP Server.

To make a router a DHCP Relay Agent, simply put the “ip helper-address <IP-address-of-DHCP-Server>” command under the interface that receives the DHCP messages from the DHCP Client.

DHCP and Linux Configuration (https://linuxconfig.org/what-is-dhcp-and-how-to-configure-dhcp-server-in-linux)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DHCP server keeps a record of all leased IP addresses and stores them in a file called dhcpd.leases within  /var/lib/dhcp directory

1: To install DHCP on linux
	- apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
	- yum install dhcp
	
2: Basic DHCP configuration
To start DHCP server, at least one subnet must be defined within the DHCP configuration file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. 

NOTE: if your server has access to more than one subnet, DHCP requires all subnets to be defined even though there isn't immediate intention to enable DHCP service on that subnet

subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.254;
}

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
} 
This configuration file instructs DHCP server to listen for DHCP client requests on subnet 10.1.1.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0.
Furthermore, it will assign IP addresses in range 10.1.1.3 - 10.1.1.254

Alter the above code  with your subnet and insert it into /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
Then restart the dhcp server 

$ service isc-dhcp-server restart

DHCP default and max lease time
--------------------------------
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.254;
}

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
}

Define DNS Server
--------------------
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.254;
  option domain-name-servers 10.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
}

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
}

subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.1.1.3 10.1.1.254;
  option routers 10.1.1.1;
}
