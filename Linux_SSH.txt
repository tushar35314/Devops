To add a user in EC2 User
============================
1: Setting up the Security Groups
	Set the inbound rules, such that the source is set correctly 	
2: Create the instance, one server and atleast one client machine

Server end
-----------
- Create a user: useradd -d /home/test -m test
- Login as the newly created user: su test
- Create the ssh keys: ssh-keygen -t rsa
- This will create the public and private key


Client end
------------
- Create a user: uderadd -d /home/test -m test
- Login as the newly created user: su test
- create a folder named .ssh: mkdir .ssh
- Change the mod of folder: chmod 700 .ssh
- Create a file 'authorized_keys'
- Add the server's public key to the authorized_keys
- Change the mode of the file: chmod 600 authorized_keys

To ssh (from the server's end)
