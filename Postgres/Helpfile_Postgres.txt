PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS).
A PostgreSQL session consists of the following cooperating processes

- A server process, which manages the database files, accepts connections to the database from client applications, and performs database actions on behalf of the clients

- The user's client (frontend) application that wants to perform database operations.

The PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts (“forks”) a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention by the original postgres process. 

Command to create database: $ createdb mydb
Command to remove the database: $ dropdb mydb

Running the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program, called psql, which allows you to interactively enter, edit, and execute SQL commands.

Run psql, to start the interactive session. 

To display the version: SELECT version();
To display the Current Date: SELECT current_date;

There are a variety of PostgreSQL Internal command that start with '\'. For example to list of the syntax of the various SQL command : \h
To quit the interactive session: \q
To connect to a database named cfmponitdb: \c cfmponitdb
To list the available tables: \dt
To describe the table : \d

Select Statement
-------------------
SELECT * FROM account;	//Without the ; the statement will not execute



Two dashes (“--”) introduce comments.

PostgreSQL supports the standard SQL types int, smallint, real, double precision, char(N), varchar(N), date, time, timestamp, and interval, as well as other types of general utility and a rich set of geometric types.
